You've successfully installed Tinfoil, and it's running well. But what if the text in the app is not in your preferred language? You might have looked through Tinfoil's "Options" tab and noticed there's no setting to change the language.

Don't worry, the solution is very simple.

The key thing to understand is that **Tinfoil does not have its own internal language setting.** Instead, it automatically detects and uses the system language of your Nintendo Switch console. To change the language in Tinfoil, you need to change your Switch's language.

This guide will show you exactly how to do that.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Changing Your Switch's System Language

Follow these steps on your Nintendo Switch's main menu. The icons should help you find the right options even if the current language is one you don't understand.

1.  From your Switch's HOME Menu, select the **System Settings** icon (it looks like a gear ⚙️).

2.  In the System Settings menu on the left, scroll all the way down and select the **System** option (it has an icon of the Switch console).

3.  On the right-hand side, the first option will be **Language**. Select it.

4.  A list of available languages will appear. When you select one, your Switch tells Tinfoil which language file to use via a standard code. Tinfoil supports many of these, including:
    * English (`en-US` / `en-GB`)
    * Español (`es-LA` / `es-ES`)
    * Français (`fr-CA` / `fr-FR`)
    * Deutsch (`de`)
    * Italiano (`it`)
    * Nederlands (`nl`)
    * Português (`pt-BR` / `pt-PT`)
    * And several others.

5.  Select your desired language from the list and press 'A' to confirm.

6.  A message will appear asking you to restart the console for the change to take effect. Select **"Restart"**.

### Verifying the Change in Tinfoil

Once your Switch has restarted, the entire home menu and all official applications will be in the new language you selected.

Now, launch Tinfoil again. The application's interface—its tabs, options, and descriptions—should now be displayed in your chosen language, making it much easier to navigate.

### What If My Language Isn't Supported?

If you change your Switch's system language to one that Tinfoil does not have a translation for (for example, Polish or Korean), the application will typically default to **English** because it cannot find a matching language file.

And that's it! Changing Tinfoil's language is as easy as changing your console's main language setting.
