Tinfoil is one of the most powerful applications for a modded Nintendo Switch, but because it's so complex, things can sometimes go wrong. An unexpected crash or a cryptic error can be frustrating, especially for beginners.

Don't worry. Most Tinfoil issues are well-known and can be fixed with a few simple steps. This guide combines the most common problems and solutions to help you get back up and running.

### The "Before You Panic" Checklist

Before diving into specific errors, always perform these basic steps. They solve over 90% of all homebrew issues.

1.  **Update Everything:** The Switch homebrew scene moves fast. Mismatched software versions are the number one cause of crashes. Make sure you have the absolute latest versions of:
    * **Atmosphère:** Your Custom Firmware.
    * **Hekate:** Your bootloader.
    * **Sigpatches:** These are crucial and **must** match your version of Atmosphère.
    * **Tinfoil:** The app itself.

2.  **Check Your SD Card:** A faulty or poorly formatted SD card can cause a huge range of problems.
    * **Format:** Use **FAT32** for the best stability. The exFAT format is convenient but is notoriously prone to corruption on the Switch.
    * **Check for Errors:** Use a tool like `h2testw` (Windows) or `F3` (Mac/Linux) to test your card for hidden errors.
    * **Free Space:** Ensure you have enough empty space for downloads and installations.

3.  **Restart Your Switch:** It sounds simple, but a full reboot (powering off completely and turning back on) can often resolve temporary glitches.

### Common Problems and Solutions

If you've followed the checklist and still have trouble, find your specific issue below.

#### Problem: Tinfoil Crashes, Freezes, or Won't Launch

You try to open Tinfoil, and it hangs on a black screen, immediately crashes, or shows a generic error.

* **Solution 1: Update Sigpatches.** This is the most common cause. Ensure your sigpatches match your Atmosphère version.
* **Solution 2: Use the NRO Version.** If you installed a "forwarder" icon on your home screen and it's not working, try launching the `tinfoil.nro` file directly from the Homebrew Menu (hold 'R' while launching a game).

#### Problem: "Failed to Install NSP" or Downloads Fail

You try to install a file, but it fails midway through, or a download from a shop won't start.

* **Solution 1: Check Sigpatches.** As above, this is a primary cause for installation failures.
* **Solution 2: Check Your Internet.** Make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi and not in Airplane Mode.
* **Solution 3: Try a Different Shop/Source.** The server you are downloading from might be down or experiencing issues. Try a different source to see if the problem persists.
* **Solution 4: Check for Corrupt Files.** If installing from your SD card, the file itself might be corrupt. Try downloading it again.

#### Problem: Games Not Showing Up / Shops Are Empty

You've added a shop, but no new content appears in the "New Games" tab.

* **Solution 1: Check for DNS Blockers.** Services like **90DNS** will block access to shops. Use Atmosphère's built-in `exosphere.ini` method to block Nintendo instead, as it doesn't interfere with other network activity.
* **Solution 2: Rebuild Tinfoil's Database.** Tinfoil keeps a database of titles. Sometimes this can get corrupted. Navigate to `/switch/tinfoil/db/` on your SD card and delete the file `titles.us.en.json` (or similar). The next time Tinfoil launches, it will rebuild this database.

#### Problem: "Corrupted Data Has Been Detected" on the Switch Home Menu

You see the Tinfoil icon on your home screen, but the Switch gives you a "corrupted data" error when you try to launch it.

* **Solution: Reinstall the Forwarder.** This error is specific to the home screen icon. The safest way to launch Tinfoil is always from the **Homebrew Menu**. To fix the icon, delete it from your home screen and use the Tinfoil Installer `.nro` to create a fresh one.

#### Problem: Configuration Settings Are Not Saving

You change a setting in Tinfoil's options, but it reverts back the next time you open the app.

* **Solution: Exit Tinfoil Correctly.** Do not just press the Home button to close Tinfoil. You must exit the application through its own menu, which properly saves all configuration changes.

### Final Troubleshooting Steps

If nothing else works, try these last resorts.

* **Check Date and Time:** Ensure your Switch's date and time are correct and set to update automatically via the internet. Incorrect time can cause issues with network protocols.
* **Reset Shop Locations:** If you suspect an issue with your added shops, you can delete the `locations.conf` file from the `/switch/tinfoil/` folder to remove all of them and start fresh.

By methodically working through this list, you can solve nearly any issue you might encounter with Tinfoil.
